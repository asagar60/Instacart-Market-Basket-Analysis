## Description
In this project we will try to solve Kaggle's Instacart Market Basket Analysis problem.

To know more about the approach, refer my medium blog post,

Part 1:

Part 2:

Part 3: 

## Data Files
- All files used in this project, are generated through Feature Engineering. All py files needed to do this are added to this repo.
- Since all of those files can't be uploaded here, I will leave a project directory structure, incase anyone wants to clone this repo and reproduce results.

The following directory Structure is followed for deployment folder

## Deployed application

## Future Work
- [ ]  Deploy this application on a remote server using AWS.
- [ ] Display Images of products along with the names instead of names alone.
- [ ] To find an end to end Deep Learning solution for this problem. 
- [ ] Extend this solution, to provide even more recommendations , such as for each product from the recommendations, suggest an item which was most frequently purchased with it . This can be done using Apriori Algorithm.
